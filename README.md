# heat-u2u

Heat u2u (user 2 user) is a WebRtc based messaging protocol where users can chat and share files through peer 2 peer technology.

What makes Heat u2u special is the fact that HEAT blockchain network servers who chose to do so can act as decentralized relay servers to facilitate the initial connection between users before they disconnect from the blockchain server and continue their peer 2 peer communication.

## Project setup

This project is based on Typescript and should be used as a building block for a heat-u2u based chat app that runs in a browser or as a browser extension.

The layout was inspired by this post https://www.metachris.com/2021/04/starting-a-typescript-project-in-2021/ and accompanying repo https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate
